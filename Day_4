Windows Boot Process
    BIOS vs UEFI
        BIOS and UEFI do the same thing, but minor differences make UEFI more popular than BIOS in the current day.
            UEFI Boots much faster than BIOS systems, especially for Windows machines.
            UEFI Firmware is usually loaded into flash memory or EEPROM, making it easier to update and patch.=
            UEFI offers SECURED BOOT mode which only allows verified drivers to load.
            UEFI offers drive support of up to 9 zettabytes, while BIOS only works with 2 terabytes.
