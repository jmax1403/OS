        Prefetch will prepare a command before you run it so it will retrieve results faster
        PS C:\> Get-Childitem -Path 'C:\Windows\Prefetch' -ErrorAction Continue | select -First 8
            This command prefetches the first 8 results from gci by using -path 'C:\Windows\Prefetch'
    
    Browser Artifacts
        Areas of interest in Google Chrome History Files:
            1. URLS
            The urls table contains the basic browsing history for Chrome. This will include a single instance for all the URLs visited, a timestamp for the last time visited, and a counter for the number of times visited.
            2. Current Session/Tabs
            If you are examining a system that still has an active session available, Chrome will store the browsing activity here under current session and if there are multiple tabs open it will store it under current tabs.
            3. Top Sites
            Chrome shows the user their most frequently visited sites in panels on a homepage, which allows the user to quickly click on a frequently visited site. We recover the data around any URL that is listed as a “Top Site” in Chrome.
