Linux Process Validation
    Startup Processes
        Kernel space processes
            [kthreadd] (PID = 2)
            kthreadd spawned processes have a PPID of 2
            Kernel psace processes are surrounded by []
        User-Space Processes 
            /sbin/init (PID = 1)

    Process Ownership
        A user is an entity that can run processes and own files
        grep UID /etc/login.defs
            Show range of UIDs for system and human users
            ex.
                UID_MIN			 1000
                UID_MAX			60000
                #SYS_UID_MIN      100
                #SYS_UID_MAX      999
    System calls
        fork()
            creates a new procss by duplicating the calling process. the new proc is the child and the original is the parent
        exec()
            When a process is called with exec() it replaces the current process
    Forground and Background processes
        Orphan Processes
            a running process whose parent process has finished or terminated and is adopted by sbin/init
            disown -a && exit 
                #Close a shell/terminal and force all children to be adopted
        Zombie Processes
            a process that has completed execution but hasn’t been reaped by its parent process.

        Daemons
           intentionally orphaned process in order to have a background process.
    
    Cronjob
        System cron jobs
            run as root and rigidly scheduled
            perform system-wide maintenance tasks (Cleaning out /tmp or rotating logs)
            controlled by /etc/crontab
        User cron jobs
            Use 'crontab’ command to create user cron jobs
            stored in /var/spool/cron/crontabs/
        CRONTAB SYNTAX
            crontab -u [user] file This command will load the crontab data from the specified file
            crontab -l -u [user] This command will display/list user’s crontab contents
            crontab -r -u [user] This Command will remove user’s crontab contents
            crontab -e -u [user] This command will edit user’s crontab contents
        
    Proc dir
        File Descriptors
            sudo lsof -c <Proc name>
                List all open files for a specific process.
            sudo ls -l /proc/14139
                List contents for that PID directory.

Other Commands
    ps -elf #Displays processes
        -e #Displays every process on the system
        -l #Lists processes in a long format
        -f #Does a full-format listing
    ps --ppid 2 -lf #Displays only kthreadd processes (so, only kernel-space processes)
         Processes spawned from kthreadd will always have a PPID of 2
    ps --ppid 2 -Nlf #Displays anything except kthreadd processes (so, only user-space processes)
        -N #Negates the selection
    ps -elf --forest #Displays processes in an ASCII tree
        --forest #ASCII art process tree
