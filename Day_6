    Process Validity
        Being able to verify and destinguish a process from possible malicious processes

            registry keys
            files
            drivers
    DLLs
        Dynamically Linked Libraries
        Used by different processes to draw information from the same location but use it for different processes
        Cannot be directly executed
        tasklist /m (Displays all modules and DLLs associated to processes)

            C:\sc qc eventlog                  # Show the binary command that loads the service
            C:\sc showsid eventlog             # Displays the service SID and status
            c:\sc enmudepend                   # Lists the services that cannot run unless the specified service is running
